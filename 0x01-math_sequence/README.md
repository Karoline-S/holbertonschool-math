## Math - Sequence

#Holberton School Foundations

**Advanced Tasks

0. Write a function that returns the Heron sequence until having convergence with an error less or equal to 10 to the power of -7.
1. Code the Fibonacci sequence until having a geometric behavior. How can we deduce the gold number ?
2. Code the Mandelbrot’s set in a PGM file mandelbrot.pgm with a recurrent sequence: zn+1 = zn squared + c where the width = 1000 pixels, the height = 1000 pixels and the maximum of iterations = 255.
3. Code the Julia’s Set in a PGM file with a recurrent sequence: zn+1 = zn squared + c and output the results into 6 PGM files for each of a set of c complex numbers.
